	Fear it can be your key to success or the cage that keeps you bound. The goal of my work is to reveal the relentless truths and the relentless lies of the world.  My Current work is based around weapons whether they are for war or citizen use or for both. 
	As a child from a small village in the thumb of Michigan, I was always told, weapons are bad and dangerous, but being told not to have anything to do with them and or being told not to use them, always peaked my interest because when you tell a kid no they want to know why. Through my research I realized people just don’t understand why people want to keep and or get rid of guns, its fear. Fear is the ultimate motivator.
	Fear being the ultimate motivator, the key to success, or the cage that binds you really summarizes what I'm trying to do with my work, don’t let the fear win and you may be able to achieve your deepest desires.
